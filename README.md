# Sunshine Weather App

This Android app uses the OpenWeatherMap API data to display weather information depending of the user location and preferences. By applying the fundamentals of Android Wear, a smartwatch face was implemented for the app, taking into account the multiple watch form factors currently available (square or round). This weather app implements data exchange functionality between the mobile device and the wearable device. This project was built as part of the Android Nanodegree portfolio.


## Why this Project

Extending an app to Android Wear smart watches allows developers to reach users wherever and whenever they’d want or need the mobile app's functionality. Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate an app more directly into users’ lives.

## Important

In order for the app to download and display weather information, you need to use your own API key and add it to gradle.properties. You can get an API key at: http://openweathermap.org/appid
